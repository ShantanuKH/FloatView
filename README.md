# FloatView

###  Floating View App with PIP Dependency in Flutter

This Flutter application demonstrates the implementation of Picture-in-Picture (PIP) mode . The app allows users to minimize the main content into a small floating window while displaying other content, facilitating a multitasking experience similar to video streaming apps or chat applications.

## Features

- **Picture-in-Picture Mode**: Minimize the main screen into a floating window.
- **Dynamic Content Switching**: Display additional content while the main screen is in floating mode.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts layout to avoid system UI intrusions like notches and status bars.
